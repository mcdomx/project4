#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

This project is going much better than the first Django project that I did.  Understanding how the models work has helped tremendously.  Also understanding how data transfers between Django and Javascript has helped.  I've made better use of Django templating when possible.

Despite this, I still run into various issues when aligning data between Javascript and Django.  Syntax of Django continues to force me to re-lookup items in the documentation.  It has been time intensive; however, I have been able to solve every problem that I have encountered.
